        <p>
            In computer programming, a variable is an abstract storage location paired with an associated symbolic name,
            which contains some known or unknown quantity of information referred to as a value; or in simpler terms, a
            variable is a named container for a particular set of bits or type of data.</p>

        <p>In computer programming, operators are constructs defined within programming languages which behave generally
            like functions, but which differ syntactically or semantically. Common simple examples include arithmetic,
            comparison, and logical operations. Wikipedia

                    <p>In computer programming, a bitwise operation operates on a bit string, a bit array or a binary
                        numeral at the level of its individual bits. It is a fast and simple action, basic to the
                        higher-level arithmetic operations and directly supported by the processor.

                    <p>In computer programming, a loop is a sequence of instruction s that is continually repeated until
                        a certain condition is reached. Typically, a certain process is done, such as getting an item of
                        data and changing it, and then some condition is checked such as whether a counter has reached a
                        prescribed number.</p>

                    <p>In computer science a for-loop or for loop is a control flow statement for specifying iteration.
                        Specifically, a for loop functions by running a section of code repeatedly until a certain
                        condition has been satisfied. For-loops have two parts: a header and a body.</p>

                    <p>In most computer programming languages, a while loop is a control flow statement that allows code
                        to be executed repeatedly based on a given Boolean condition. The while loop can be thought of
                        as a repeating if statement.</p>

                        condition. The do while construct consists of a process symbol and a condition. First the code
                        within the block is executed.</p>

                        identified by at least one array index or key. An array is stored such that the position of each
                        element can be computed from its index tuple by a mathematical formula</p>

                        constant or as some kind of variable. The latter may allow its elements to be mutated and the
                        length changed, or it may be fixed</p>

                        enclosed within curly brackets ({}) that take inputs, do the computation, and provide the
                        resultant output. You can call a function multiple times, thereby allowing reusability and
                        modularity in C programming.</p>
