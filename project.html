          <u>1.variable -</u>
    </h2>  
    <p>
        In computer programming, a variable is an abstract storage location paired with an associated symbolic name, which contains some known or unknown quantity of information referred to as a value; or in simpler terms, a variable is a named container for a particular set of bits or type of data.</p>
    
   <h2> <u>2.operator -</u></h2>
    <p>In computer programming, operators are constructs defined within programming languages which behave generally like functions, but which differ syntactically or semantically. Common simple examples include arithmetic, comparison, and logical operations. Wikipedia

   <u> <h3>A.arithmatic operator -</h3></u>
    <p>An arithmetic operator performs mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division etc on numerical values (constants and variables). Operator. Meaning of Operator.</p>
    
    <u> <h3>b.ralational operator -</h3></u>
    <p>There are six relational operators in python. The Relational operators in python are: Equal To(==), Not Equal To(! =), Greater Than(>), Less Than(<), Greater Than or Equal To(>=), and Lesser Than or Equal To(<=)</p>

    <u> <h3>c.bitwise operator -</h3></u>
    <p>In computer programming, a bitwise operation operates on a bit string, a bit array or a binary numeral at the level of its individual bits. It is a fast and simple action, basic to the higher-level arithmetic operations and directly supported by the processor. 
    </p>
    
    <u> <h3>d.logical operator -</h3></u>
    <P>A logical operator is a symbol or word used to connect two or more expressions such that the value of the compound expression produced depends only on that of the original expressions and on the meaning of the operator. Common logical operators include AND, OR, and NOT.
    </P>

    <u> <h3>e.assingment operator -</h3></u>
    <p>In the C++ programming language, the assignment operator, =, is the operator used for assignment. Like most other operators in C++, it can be overloaded.</p>
